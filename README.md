# Coq learning note

On the days when I am still a student studying mathematics in SJTU, *MATH1406H: Advanced Algebra (H) II* is exactly one of my biggest nightmares. Prof. Jiang, the instructor of the class, is a great researcher who has an intuition for algebra objects and concepts. It is normal to feel helpless and depressed facing this kind of researchers, especially when you find it difficult to figure out what those "obvious" things mean.

It is the time when I first came up with the idea to build an automatic something. (Now I know this is what people call the **automatic theorem proving**, or to be more practical, the **Automata**) 

As the approach to my goal, I began to learn Coq. This is a kind of interactive proofing tool. Although this is not exactly an automatic thing, it offers a formal view of the mathematical proofing progress and the computer programming, which means a lot for further learning.

Another reason why I chose Coq instead of Lean4 or other languages is that Coq offers a detailed official document named *Software Foundations*. This note mainly focuses on the exercises in the documents. At the same time, I tried to contribute a formal proofing system for the *Advanced Algebra* written by Xianke Zhang (张贤科). This is the textbook used by MATH1406H at SJTU before. I cannot say if it is a good textbook, as I didn't really understand it. I hope that after the contribution, I can know more about both formal methods and algebra.
